# Supplementary Materials: An Illustrative Example
This repository includes a GeNIe [^1] project file that is used for the illustrative example presented in our manuscript, "*Observation or Intervention: Inference with Bayesian Belief Networks in Tourism Research*".

## How to Use
- **Download and install GeNIe** Download the GeNIe modeling environment from [the BayesFusion website](https://www.bayesfusion.com/downloads/). To install the software, follow the installation instructions on the GeNIe download page.
- **Download the GeNIe project file** Right-click [AIllustractiveBBN](https://github.com/AlyeskaBear/BBNsInToursim/blob/main/AIllustractiveBBN.xdsl) and choose "Save link as..." and then save it to your desired location.
- **Open the file and compile the model** Double-click the saved file and open it in the GeNIe modeling environment. To compile the model and display each variable’s probability distribution, click the “Update” (lightning) icon on the toolbar of the modeling environment. For other inferential tasks, please refer to further instructions in our manuscript.
