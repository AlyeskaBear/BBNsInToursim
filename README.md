# Supplementary Materials: An Illustrative Example
This repository includes the GeNIe project file used for the illustrative example presented in our manuscript, "*Observation or Intervention: Inference with Bayesian Belief Networks in Tourism Research*".

## Quick Start
**1. Install GeNIe**
  - Download the GeNIe modeling environment from [the BayesFusion website](https://www.bayesfusion.com/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

**2. Download the example model**
  - Click the [AIllustractiveBBN.xdsl](https://github.com/AlyeskaBear/BBNsInToursim/blob/main/AIllustractiveBBN.xdsl) link, then select `Download file` in the upper‑right corner to save it to your computer..

**3. Open and compile the model**
  - Double-click the saved file to launch it in GeNIe.
  - Click the **Update** (_⚡_) icon on the toolbar to compile the network and display each variable's probability distribution.

For other inference tasks (e.g., diagnostic  vs. causal), please refer to the detailed walkthrough in our manuscript.
